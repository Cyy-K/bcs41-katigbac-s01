About Me 

I am Cyrus Katigbac, 21 years old and currently a Computer Science student
at De La Salle University - Dasmarinas. I enjoy playing video games that involves
strategy. 

My motivation on joining this bootcamp is something that I have wanted for
a long time. Just as I take the specialization in Game Development at the university,
I am curious on how games were being developed and I would like to develop an official
game in the future,

My work experience is my internship at Highly Succeed Inc. This is my first work experience 
and it has been good for my personal and career growth as I have learned a lot there.
