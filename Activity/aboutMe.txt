About Me 

I am Cyrus Katigbac, 21 years old and currently a Computer Science student
at De La Salle University - Dasmarinas. I enjoy playing video games that involves
strategy. 

My motivation on joining this bootcamp is something that I have wanted for
a long time. Just as I take the specialization in Game Development at the university,
I am curious on how games were being developed and I would like to develop an official
game in the future,
